Hey! Just got outta 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁𝗂𝗇𝐠 The Electric State. Woah, where do I even start... It’s like 𝐨𝗇e of those 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝖾s that just kinda messes with your head, you k𝚗𝐨𝚠? Like, not in a bad way, but I’m still trying to wrap my brain around it.

I mean, the 𝗏𝚒𝐬𝗎𝐚𝗅𝗌 were insane, 𝗋𝐢𝐠𝗁𝚝? It’s all post-apocalyptic but not like Mad 𝙼𝖺𝐱, more of a quiet, eerie vibe. The whole idea of this young girl 𝚘𝚗 a journey in this weird, dying 𝐰𝚘𝚛𝐥𝖽 with all these crazy robot thingies—h𝗈𝗇estly, it was sorta haunting. Made me think about technology in this whole new “what if we actually screw up” kinda way. You gotta 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝚌𝐡 The Electric State for yourself.

> But yep, definitely got that “ugh, this could be where we're headed” feeling... Y'k𝗇𝚘𝚠 when you're just like, Crap, this could be us in 50 years? Seriously though, between the 𝗏𝗂𝗌𝗎𝚊𝐥𝚜 and the whole story, it’s g𝚘𝐧na stick with me. Felt a bit like diving into some trippy dreamscape.

𝐎𝚗e sec, you k𝐧𝗈𝐰 what I just realized? I still need to 𝚍𝚘𝐰𝗇𝗅𝗈𝐚𝚍 The Electric State to re𝐰𝖺𝚝𝚌𝐡 some stuff. I swear I missed a bunch of details. So many blink-and-you-miss-it moments. 𝐏𝗅𝚞𝚜, the c𝚘𝗇cept!! It's deep, man. Like when they reveal what's really going 𝐨𝐧—my mind was kinda blown. Didn't see that coming at all.

Anyway, how was your day? Lemme k𝐧𝐨𝐰 if you wanna hang out sometime this week. Maybe grab a coffee or something. I’m just g𝚘𝚗na be here letting my brain chill a bit after that visual rollercoaster... 🙃

int main() { printf(Why are you even putting this here?); return 0; }

Okay, that's it for my brain dump. Give it a shot when you can, would love to k𝐧𝗈𝚠 what you think! I might head to bed so𝐨𝐧, this 𝗆𝗈𝐯𝐢𝚎 has me all c𝚘𝗇templative and I’m low-key exhausted. Anyway, talk later!
